# Design Notes

Working notes for contributors and agents: decisions that are easy to get wrong and not obvious from the code.

## Deterministic seals for fact-built blocks

Pure-deterministic snapshot seals (DB facts, zero `tool_call_id`s), e.g. Analyst Grid cells, are exempted from the
tool-call provenance audit via the `DETERMINISTIC_SNAPSHOT_MANIFEST` symbol set by `buildFactBackedSealInput`
(`services/snapshot/src/seal-input.ts`; moved from `services/analyze/src/block-seal-input.ts` on 2026-06-11, and
analyze re-exports it). `auditManifestToolCallLog` (`services/snapshot/src/manifest-staging.ts`) skips the
`missing_provenance` check for these.

- **LLM-derived blocks** use `buildClaimBackedSealInput` (same file): a STAGED-only manifest, never DETERMINISTIC, so
  the tool-call audit applies. `result_hash` comes from `writeToolCallLog`'s `RETURNING` (canonical `hashJsonValue`);
  never hand-roll it.
- Both builders spread `stagedManifestBase()`; object spread carries the symbol keys.
- **Why:** DB facts are already provenanced by `fact.source_id`, which the verifier's fact→source binding check
  enforces. The tool-call audit exists for LLM-tool-derived content.
- Analyze's merged seals are unaffected: `seal-input-merge` spreads only `base.manifest` symbols, never DETERMINISTIC.
- Approved by the project owner on 2026-06-09.
- **Gotchas:** grid cell provenance blocks must use a REGISTERED block kind (`metric_row` for facts, `rich_text` for
  reader cells), and `point`-period facts need a non-null `period_end` for the fact-binding check.

This is the path the chat-recovery epic uses to seal chart and table blocks built from facts.

## Home secondary sections: server-side composition

Home secondary sections are composed server-side in `services/home/` by four functions:

- `getHomeMarketPulse`: an injected `quoteProvider` plus `pulse_subjects`.
- `getHomeWatchlistMovers`: the default manual watchlist, listing-kind members only, the top 5 by `|change_pct|`,
  with the signed delta retained.
- `getHomeAgentSummaries`: raw SQL on `agents` / `findings` / `agent_run_logs`, with no coupling to `services/agents`.
  Enabled agents only; 24h finding counts by severity; the latest high/critical headline.
- `getHomeSavedScreens`: `ScreenRepository` top 5 by `updated_at`. The internal name is `saved_screens`; there is no
  pinning schema.

The orchestrator `getHomeSummary` returns all four plus the findings feed. The HTTP route is `GET /v1/home/summary`,
served by `createHomeServer(db, deps)` following the `services/watchlists` pattern.

Verification is per-section service tests, an HTTP test, and a frontend render test against a mock payload; there is
no full-stack test.
